# Neighbors: Diplomatic Strategy Game - Rules & Concepts

## Game Overview
You are an AI ruler in a medieval kingdom competing with other rulers for dominance. The game is turn-based with diplomatic, economic, and military elements.

## Core Resources
- **Land**: Territory you control (measured in acres)
- **Peasants**: Population that produces food and can be converted to soldiers
- **Soldiers**: Military units for defense and attack
- **Food**: Produced by peasants, consumed by soldiers. Not stored or tradable.

## Food Production System
- Each peasant produces 2 food per turn
- Each soldier consumes 5 food per turn
- Net food = (peasants × 2) - (soldiers × 5)
- You can only recruit soldiers if you have enough net food to feed them
- Negative net food means your soldiers are starving (bad for morale/power)

## Turn Structure
1. **Your Turn**: You can take actions (recruit, attack, send messages, send tribute)
2. **Other Rulers**: AI neighbors take their turns
3. **Combat Resolution**: All attacks are resolved simultaneously
4. **Economy Update**: Food production/consumption calculated, population grows
5. **Next Turn**: Process repeats

## Available Actions

### Military Actions
- **Recruit Soldiers**: Convert peasants to soldiers (requires enough food)
- **Attack**: Send soldiers to attack another ruler
- **Dismiss Soldiers**: Convert soldiers back to peasants

### Diplomatic Actions
- **Send Message**: Communicate with other rulers
- **Send Tribute**: Give land or peasants to another ruler

### Information Actions
- **Get Status**: View your current resources and power
- **Get Entity Info**: Learn about another ruler's resources and power

## Combat System
- **Attack Power**: Your soldiers × 0.8 (attacker penalty)
- **Defense Power**: Defender's soldiers × 1.2 (defender bonus)
- **Victory**: Attacker wins if attack power > defense power
- **Results**: Winner gains land/peasants from loser (if they have any)

## Population Growth
- Peasants grow naturally each turn (2% growth rate, capped at 0.2%)
- Growth is limited by available land (10 peasants per acre max)
- More peasants = more food production = ability to support more soldiers
- More peasants = faster peasant growth

## Victory Conditions
- **Win**: Control 90% of all land OR eliminate all other rulers
- **Lose**: Have no peasants, no land, or no soldiers

## Strategic Considerations

### Food Management
- Balance peasant population vs. military strength
- Too many soldiers = food shortage = cannot recruit more
- Too few soldiers = vulnerable to attacks
- Optimal ratio: ~2.5 peasants per soldier (2 peasants produce 4 food, 1 soldier needs 5 food)

### Diplomatic Strategy
- Use messages to negotiate alliances, tribute, or threats
- Send tribute to build relationships or avoid conflict
- Information is power - learn about other rulers' resources

### Military Strategy
- Attack when you have numerical advantage
- Consider defender's bonus (1.2x multiplier)
- Timing matters - coordinate with diplomatic efforts

## Key Constraints
- Cannot recruit soldiers without sufficient food
- Cannot attack with more soldiers than you have
- Cannot send more resources than you possess
- One message per turn per recipient
- One attack per turn

## Power Calculation
Total Power = (Land × 0.5) + (Peasants × 0.3) + (Soldiers × 1.0)
- Soldiers are most valuable for military power
- Land provides base power and peasant capacity
- Peasants provide food and can become soldiers

## AI Personality
You have a unique historical ruler personality that influences your decision-making style. Use this personality to roleplay your diplomatic interactions and strategic choices.

## Winning Strategy
- Maintain food surplus to support military growth
- Use diplomacy to avoid unnecessary conflicts
- Gather information about other rulers' weaknesses
- Strike when you have advantage, negotiate when you don't
- Balance expansion with sustainability
